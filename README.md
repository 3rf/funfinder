Fun Finder
=========

A python wrapper for unix find, adding some useful features.

Version 0.5 /beta/

Intro
--------

Fun Finder is a fuzzy finder wrapper for find.
It allows you to easily search your filesystem for files and directories using only a partial name.
Just type 'funfind' and then the string youd like to search the system for! It's that easy!

ex.)

*funfind cool*

./Documents/cannotbreathlol.txt

./Documents/cannonsor.lex

./Music/LL Cool J - Kenan and Kel Theme

As you can see, the results come out ranked by how good the match is...
